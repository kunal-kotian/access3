To do and notes:

-- Why use BytesIO 
I think it avoids writing a file to disk
(need to check speed too)
see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37703634/how-to-import-a-text-file-on-aws-s3-into-pandas-without-writing-to-disk/37703861

-- Also add way to save csv files

-- getting rid of boto3
https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
s3fs sits on top of boto3â€¦.may be possible to get rid of boto3

try this for speed compariosn (avoids bytesio)
with fs.open(player_list[0]+'.pickle','wb') as f:
   pickle.dump(df1, f)

use of pyarrow:
feather package already sits on top of pyarrow.
based on we mckinney's blog, it looked like pyarrow might be slightly faster than feather
also, if you have feather you don't need to install pyarrow

add ability to read and write directly from pickle files without using pd.read_pickle.
see: kk_topic_modeling_v1-15_S3pickling.ipynb
can test on loading vocab_dictionary


### check if the data types are being restored when you load a dataframe from pickled file
